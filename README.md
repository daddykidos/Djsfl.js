**DaKi Javascript function library - Djsfl.js**
Note: This variant will no longer be the focus for development as djsflV2.js will now be the new standard for development as it is more optimized than this variant

This is a minimal javascript library for some simple graphical stuff

May not be intended for others to use as this library has some drastic changes from time to time in the functionality of the functions of this library, although you are free to use it as you like.
